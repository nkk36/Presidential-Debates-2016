# README

Repository for a text analysis I'm working on. 

## Ideas for Analysis:

1. Compare words spoken at the individual-level or party-level. Look at how many words were categorized correctly/incorrectly like [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/text_topicmodels.html)
2. Top terms in each topic
3. Correlation matrix at the individual/party-level like [here](http://www.bernhardlearns.com/2017/05/topic-models-lda-and-ctm-in-r-with.html)
4. Words that are more probable in one topic vs. another like [here](http://www.bernhardlearns.com/2017/05/topic-models-lda-and-ctm-in-r-with.html)


## Notes

* Conduct parameter tuning as shown [here](http://www.bernhardlearns.com/2017/05/topic-models-lda-and-ctm-in-r-with.html) or use perplexity as shown [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/text_topicmodels.html#lda_with_an_unknown_topic_structure)
* Another [similar](http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-candidates-in-their-own-words.pdf) analysis by a researcher at AEI
